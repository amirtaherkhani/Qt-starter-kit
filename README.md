# Qt Starter Kit with QML GUI and Plugin-Based Microservice Architecture

This **Qt Starter Kit** is designed to simplify and accelerate the development of embedded applications. It combines a **QML-based GUI**, a **microservice architecture**, and **plugin support** for modularity and scalability. This kit is ideal for projects requiring dynamic extensibility for both UI and backend services.

This project serves as a robust starting point for building embedded applications using a QML-based GUI and a microservice architecture. It includes built-in support for dynamic plugin systems to extend both UI components and backend services, making it highly modular and extensible.

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. QML GUI**
- **Main QML File**: Serves as the entry point for the application and binds to the ViewModel for dynamic updates.
- **Reusable Components**: Encapsulated UI elements in `components/` can be reused across multiple views.
- **Data Binding**: ViewModel properties are exposed to QML for real-time updates.

### **2. Backend Services**
- Services are modular and focus on specific tasks (e.g., device interaction, data processing).
- Inter-service communication is event-driven, allowing asynchronous operation.

### **3. Plugin System**
- **QML Plugins**:
  - Pack reusable UI components into QML modules.
  - Load dynamically at runtime using `qmldir` and `plugin.cpp`.
- **Service Plugins**:
  - Implement the `IServicePlugin` interface to define new backend functionalities.
  - Loaded dynamically via the `PluginManager` using Qt's plugin framework.

## 🔄 Design Patterns

### **Selected Design Pattern: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**

#### Why MVVM for QML?
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
  - **Model**: Handles backend communication, data processing, and state management.
  - **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the GUI and the backend, exposing properties and signals to the QML.
  - **View**: Focuses purely on rendering the user interface.
- **Reactive UI**: Works seamlessly with QML's declarative binding system.
- **Testable**: Logic can be tested independently of the UI.

### **Other Patterns**

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Ensures loose coupling between services through asynchronous communication.
   - Services emit and consume events using pub-sub protocols.

2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
   - Separates read and write workflows for optimized data handling.
   - Commands for actions, queries for UI data.

3. **Service-Oriented Design**
   - Modular design with distinct functional services.
   - Each service exposes REST, gRPC, or D-Bus APIs for communication.

## 🔧 Tools and Frameworks

### **Core Tools**

- **Qt Framework**:
  - For building the QML GUI and local communication (e.g., D-Bus).
- **Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf)**:
  - For defining gRPC schemas.
- **Mosquitto MQTT**:
  - Lightweight message broker for pub-sub communication.
- **SQLite**:
  - Embedded database for persistent storage.

### **Optional Tools**

- **Docker**:
  - For containerized microservices.
- **CMake**:
  - Build automation for streamlined development.

## ⚡ Development Workflow

### **1. GUI Interaction**
- User interacts with the QML GUI.
- ViewModel handles the logic and communicates with backend services.

### **2. Service Execution**
- Backend services process requests, trigger events, or control hardware.

### **3. State Synchronization**
- A state manager updates the GUI in real-time via data binding.

### **4. Extensibility**
- Add new services or UI components without disrupting existing functionality.

## 💡 Extending the Application

### **Adding a New View**
1. Create a new `.qml` file in the `qml/views/` directory.
2. Update navigation logic or bindings to integrate the new view.

### **Adding a New Backend Service**
1. Create a new class in the `src/Services/` directory.
2. Implement the required logic for the service.
3. Integrate the service into the `ViewModel` for interaction with the UI.

### **Adding New Plugins**

#### **QML Plugin**
1. Create a new directory under `plugins/QmlPlugins/`.
2. Add your `.qml` file for the component and implement the plugin in `plugin.cpp`.
3. Register the plugin in the `qmldir` file.

#### **Service Plugin**
1. Create a new directory under `plugins/ServicePlugins/`.
2. Implement the common plugin interface (e.g., `IServicePlugin`).
3. Add a `plugin.json` file to define metadata (e.g., plugin name, description).

## 📚 Architecture Overview

### **System Components**

1. **GUI Layer (QML + QtQuick):**
   - Implements the user interface.
   - Uses the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern for separation of concerns.

2. **Service Layer (Microservices):**
   - **Device Service**: Handles hardware interactions (e.g., sensors, actuators).
   - **Data Service**: Processes and stores telemetry or configuration data.
   - **Notification Service**: Manages user/system notifications.
   - **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and permissions.

3. **Communication Layer:**
   - Supports protocols like MQTT, ZeroMQ, gRPC, and D-Bus for efficient inter-service communication.

4. **State Management:**
   - Centralized state management using a Redux-like pattern for predictable and synchronized updates across the GUI and services.

5. **Data Persistence:**
   - Local data storage using lightweight embedded databases (e.g., SQLite).
   - In-memory caching for temporary data handling.
